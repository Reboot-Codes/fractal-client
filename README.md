# Fractal Client

A Minecraft utility mod for fabric.

Fractal is designed to include just about every module you'd need, and allows you to create plugins to get the modules you want. At the moment **Fractal is not ready to be your main client/utility mod**. We like [Meteor Client](https://github/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client) because it's open-source and activley developed by great people. We'll update this when Fractal is "ready".

Still want to try it out? That's up next!

## Installation

Installing Fractal can be done by installing a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) profile in the 
official minecraft launcher. But we suggest using something like [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) 
instead, to keep your instances fully separated.

In any case, once you have a minecraft install and fabric installed, download 
the Fabric API for your specific minecraft version, and Fractal, then move 
both into the `.minecraft/mods` directory.

In future versions of Fractal, we hope to provide a better install experience, 
but for now, you'll have to do it manually.

## Usage

Fractal's settings can be customized in the Click GUI (click the fractal button in 
the title screen or press the keyboard shortcut, which by default, is the 
right shift key), or in the JSON configuration file (in 
`.minecraft/fractal-client`).

Docs are on the way, in the mean time, everything should look familiar if you've used other utility mods.
